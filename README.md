Reader ? And ever struggled to find your next book to read ?
Ok dont worry no one will suggest to go throught the process above, you can now just use the algorithm I built.


So solving the readers problem by coding was the intention behind building this recommendation system. 

For this I had three datasets. Observing the data, Preprocessing, Filling up the required gaps, understanding the algorithms, building the models, this all has been the process of it. 


I have build a recommendation system to recommend the books based on three categories. 
1. Overall most read books
2. Users past reads
3. Based on same authors or publishers
